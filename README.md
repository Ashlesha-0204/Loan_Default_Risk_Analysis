# Loan Default Risk Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Project Overview:
This project leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to help a consumer finance company in identifying critical patterns and risk factors that contribute to non-performing assets (NPAs).

# Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze customer and loan attributes to uncover key drivers of loan default. By understanding these risk factors, the company can make informed decisions on loan approvals, mitigate financial risks, and optimize its lending strategy. Specifically, the company aims to:
-  Identify clients who are likely to struggle with repayment and assess the associated risk.
-  Minimize rejection of applicants who are capable of repaying loans.

The insights gained from this analysis will help the company refine its risk assessment process, improve the accuracy of loan approvals, and ultimately enhance its financial performance by reducing defaults and missed business opportunities.
